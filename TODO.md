# TODO: Improve Book Store Website for Deployment

- [x] Fix all image src attributes in book.html to use relative paths (e.g., "image/filename.png" instead of "/Book store/image/filename.png")
- [x] Correct the footer logo src to "image/logo-removebg-preview.png"
- [x] Fix typos in headings:
  - "Feartued Books" to "Featured Books"
  - "Arrivles" to "Arrivals"
  - "Bloger" to "Blogger"
- [x] Create README.md with deployment instructions for static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify)
